# Enhanced Raid Frames

_"...makes the stock raid frames as good as Grid2 and VuhDo, but without the learning curve!"_ -Tom Hanks, probably

**Enhanced Raid Frames** is a raid frame add-on for **World of Warcraft: Shadowlands** and **World of Warcraft: Classic** that adds many small but significant features to enhance the (already quite awesome) built-in raid frames, allowing the raid frames to function much closer to add-ons such as Grid/Grid2 or VuhDo â€” the most notable addition being configurable aura indicators. 

Along with options to adjust the out-of-range distance, frame scale, frame opacity, overlay target icons, and numerous other small features, Enhanced Raid Frames adds 9 aura indicators for each raid member, forming a 3x3 grid overlaying each unit frame. These indicators allow for showing the presence, countdown time, and stack size of buffs and debuffs in any configuration that suits your needs, which has become absolutely vital for endgame content. While designed with healing in mind, other common use cases for Enhanced Raid Frames include competitive PvP, endgame tanking, or really any type of gaming that involves quick and easy access to vital information.
