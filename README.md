# Enhanced Raid Frames

_"...makes the stock raid frames as good as Grid2 and VuhDo, but without the learning curve!"_ -Tom Hanks, probably

**Enhanced Raid Frames** is a raid frame add-on for **World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth** and **World of Warcraft: Classic** that brings configurable indicators for enhancing the built in raid frames, allowing them to function much closer to add-ons such as Grid/Grid2 or VuhDo.

There are 9 indicators for each raid member, forming a 3x3 grid overlaying each unit frame. These indicators allow for showing the presence and countdown times of buffs and debuffs in any configuration that suits your needs.

## Examples:
Example of indicators on a unit. Displayed here are the cooldown frames for Rejuvenation, Germination, Regrowth, Ironbark, Spring Blossoms, Wild Growth, and Lifebloom. Notice how each HoT has a specified location to maximize readability and reflex in combat.

This is an example of what you can expect in a raid setting after setting up Enhanced Raid Frames. This example is for a restoration druid, but an experience such as this would be common for all healing (and non-healing) classes.

## Configuration
The configuration can be reached through the standard addon options (ESC -&gt; Interface -&gt; Addons -&gt; Enhanced Raid Frames)

### Aura Indicators
The following can be used as buffs/debuffs:

* **Name Buff/Debuff** - Make sure this corresponds exactly to the name of the buff/debuff
* **Spell ID** - ID of the spell to track (useful when the spell name is ambiguous, i.e. Germination)
* **"Magic / Poison / Disease / Curse"** - To show any debuffs of that category
* **"PvP"** - To show if a unit is PvP flagged
* **"ToT"** - To show if a unit is the target of your target

Likewise, there are many other options to configure such as whether to show cooldown text, stack size, tooltips, etc.

### Raid Icons:

Enhanced Raid Frames allows you to configure whether to show raid icons (skull, square, diamond, etc), and allows you to configure the size and position of the icons if shown.
